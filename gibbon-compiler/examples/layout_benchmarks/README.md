## Layout optimization benchmarks (Focusing on Relative ordering of Fields right now.)
* Long term goal is to show how layout affects performance, add factoring into picture + add string support + (after factoring support -> vectorization support)
* Tie everything to microservices, (social media apps for instance) + Render Tree benchmarks (Real world applications)

This is a collection of some benchmarks that show how layout affects performance.
In particular this set of benchmarks shows how the position of different fields in the data layout could potentially affect performance. 
The file Adts.hs contains the definitions of all the abstract data types and some other accompanying functions.
The file Strings.hs contains the definition of the data type String which is a Cons Int list. 
The file Tags.hs contains the definition of the data type Tags which is also a Cons Int list. 
the file Contents.hs contains the definition of the data type Content which can be an Image string or Text string. 

3 different scenarios: 

1.) Counting the length of two different Adts (Abstract data types) 
    CA (Content) (Adts) -> Content is serialized first before we serialize the next Adt. 
    AC (Adts) (Content) -> The next Adt is serialized first before we serialize any of the Content. 
    
    Here the function simply counts the length of the Adt given these 2 different data layouts. 
    
    Performance discussion... 
    
    Here the CA data layout results in slower performance that the AC layout. 
    This is because the CA layout inserts pointers to the next Adt so that it can skip over the Content (Since there is no processing done with the content) to count the length of the Adt.
    This causes the program to chases pointers to get to the end of the list. 
    On the other hand, the AC list does not have these pointers and simply traverses the Next directly since they are contiguous in memory. It does not have to chase pointers and the program exits when it sees Nil without having to deal with the content which is serialized after Nil Cell in the Adt. 
    
    Tested on Adt with number of cells = 1000000
                   size of the content = 100 elements

    Why are the Instructions still approx. the same when measured via PAPI?
    
    AC C code:
    ...
    CursorTy tmpcur_5265 = adt_31_923_1539 + 1;
    ...
    IntTy fltAppE_1525_1543 = 1 + accumulator_32_924_1540;
    IntTy tailapp_3360 = getLengthTR(end_r_2554, tmpcur_5265, fltAppE_1525_1543);
    ...
    
    CA C code:
    ...
    CursorTy tmpcur_5890 = adt_31_923_1539 + 1;
    ...
    CursorTy tmpcur_5891 = *(CursorTy *) tmpcur_5890;
    IntTy fltAppE_1525_1543 = 1 + accumulator_32_924_1540;
    IntTy tailapp_3835 = getLengthTR(end_r_2860, tmpcur_5891, fltAppE_1525_1543);
    ...
    
    Looking at the C code it would seem like the CA layout should have more instructions due to the extra pointer de-reference.
    Assembly Code: 
    
    AC .S code: 
    The increment of the address is computed via 
    addq	$1, %rsi
    
    
    CA .S code: 
    The increment of the address is computed via
    movq	1(%rsi), %rsi
    
    Since the CISC instruction set has an instruction for loading the pointer with an offset via movq. The total number of instructions remain the same. 
    
    
    
2.) Processing the content. Comparing the performance of CA vs AC

    t1 -> traverse Content first, next Adt second
    t2 -> traverse next Adt first, Content second
    AC -> Next adt fist, Content second
    CA -> Content first, Next Adt second
    
    k/j | AC              | CA             | 
     t1 | 1.218167e+00    | 2.664190e-01   |
     t2 | 2.654056e-01    | 1.250884e+00   |
     
3.) Processing tags when the Abstract data type has 3 fields, Tags, Content and Next Adt. 

    Here we test all the 12 permutations of the layout but and traversal order.
    
    Below are numbers for all j X k variations of the source code and data layout.
    Here j = total number of ways you can traverse the Adt, i.e, the specific order of fields you traverse. (Since the number of fields are 2 its tags first, next adt second or next adt first, tags second)
         k = total number of different layout = factorial(number of fields) = 3! = 6
    total variations = j X k = 2 X 6 = 12 variations.
    
    notation:
    t1 -> traverse tags first, next adt second
    t2 -> traverse next adt first, tags second
    d1 -> CAT -> Content first, Next Adt second, Tags third
    d2 -> CTA -> Content first, Tags second, Next Adt third
    d3 -> TAC -> Tags first, Next Adt second, Content third
    d4 -> TCA -> Tags first, Content second, Next Adt third
    d5 -> ATC -> Next Adt first, Tags second, Content third
    d6 -> ACT -> Next Adt first, Content second, Tags third
    
    Performance testing using PAPI, we measure the L2, L3 cache misses, number of Instructions and Cycles and the overall runtime.
    Each cell in the Adt has 10 tags and Content of size 2000 characters. (in the form of Text string)   
    The test makes an Adt of size 100,000 cells.
